  <p>10 Reasons to invest in Foreign Aid – Ronan Novosel

</p>Ukraine has made progress in improving its living conditions and reducing poverty thanks in part to foreign aid. In this article, we will explore the top 10 reasons why investing in foreign aid is important for Ukraine and other developing countries around the world.

1.	Support nuclear security. Supporting nuclear security is an obvious benefit. The production and development of new energy sources in Ukraine, including new nuclear facilities, can help alleviate poverty. Additionally, protecting and aiding Ukraine will prevent instability with nuclear research in the future.

2.	Environmental concerns. Sending foreign aid to Ukraine to help with domestic power production can have an abundance of benefits. Boosting Ukraine’s domestic production of natural gas, biogas, hydrogen and biomethane would stimulate the economy and allow for investment in other related sectors.

3.	Disease containment. Maximising medical care infrastructure will help the containment and securing of diseases both affecting growing and ageing populations. Agencies such as PEPFAR have been crucial to assist Ukraine in tackling AIDS/HIV.

4.	Conflict-Induced Displacement assistance. There are reports of 4.4 million Ukrainian refugees who are in need of direct support as a result of the war.

5.	Food and Relief. It has been determined that 23% of households in Ukraine will go without adequate food supplies. This can be aided with care packages easily. The United States, of its total $76.8 billion donated, $3.9 billion is donated for assistance in humanitarian problems, such as food assistance. 

6.	Investing in the future world order. The altruistic motives of the donor are clear, but in addition we have the notion of a struggle and battle for the future order of world geopolitics. In the sense that we have a demonstratable rise in nationalism and a non-dying, hyper-commercialised modern life, where corporations with vested interests remain dominant over government policy.  Ukraine exists as a bordering country between the West and East, so is a crucial sphere for this influence. 

7.	It supports political reforms. The IMF approved a loan of $5.5 billion to support economic reforms, lessening employment and coping with the harsh realties of a war economy.
8.	Help fight corruption. Supporting and strengthing the government for altruistic and personal motives alike will strengthen Ukraine and unify it for its  future redevelopment.
9.	Natural disasters. Climate change is a communal problem that affects us physically, governmentally and geopolitically. The ability to bring relief to the worst impacted areas of the world and support infrastructure to cope in the changing natural world is crucial.
10.	 Human rights. Providing aid regardless of the economic burden is essential for our collective species. Defending human rights is crucial, we can do more to prevent poverty and corruption where we see it. And for this, we all reap the spoils of peace.
